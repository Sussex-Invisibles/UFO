@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: BN132 :"/home/tony/Lattice/ufo.vhd":35:5:35:6|Removing sequential instance toggle because it is equivalent to instance fire. To keep the instance, apply constraint syn_preserve=1 on the instance.
@W: MT531 :"/home/tony/Lattice/ufo.vhd":105:5:105:6|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 1 sequential elements including arm_toggle_s1.  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"/home/tony/Lattice/ufo.vhd":51:6:51:7|Found inferred clock ufo|clk which controls 25 sequential elements including led_arm[7]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"/home/tony/Lattice/ufo.vhd":35:5:35:6|Found inferred clock ufo|trigger which controls 2 sequential elements including fire. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
